This project has been built with the assistance of AI.

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

## Data Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file named `tasks.json` in the same directory as the script. This file is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Error Handling

The application handles basic errors, such as invalid commands or task IDs. If you encounter any issues, please check your input and try again.
